    <h2><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> What is BMI?</h2>
    <p>
      Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. 
      The formula is BMI = kg/m² where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m² is their height 
      in meters squared. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method for weight category - underweight, healthy weight, 
      overweight, and obesity. However, BMI does not measure body fat directly and should not be used 
      as a diagnostic tool. It's one of several tools used to assess health status.
